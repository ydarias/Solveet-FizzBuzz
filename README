FizzBuzz Kata solution (http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataFizzBuzz)
* Done in JavaScript.
* Using Jasmine BDD and Underscore.js

Other requirements added for [Impro-Kata](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/madswcraft/events/248952891/):

1. If a number is prime then it returns 'pizz' (with lower priority than FizzBuzz when there is a collision).
1. If the number matches the last two digits of the current time in epoch format it returns the squared of that number.
